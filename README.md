## PITCH

Tired of loaning out your tools to a neighbor and losing them? Use My Tools help you keep track of who has your tools as well as creating a resource for the community.

## MVP

- Users can log in and create a profile.
- They can then set up items they have available - anything from a shovel to power washers and tile saws.
- Users will be able to Create, Read, Update and Delete data.
- A 2nd user can log in and see items that users have available and request to borrow.
- When a tool has been borrowed, the owner needs to see on their profile what tools are lent out and who has them.

## STRETCH

- Add a map for loaners to set limits on how far they are willing to lend their tools out, and how far borrowers are willing to drive to borrow something.
- Add a review system into the app so that the social aspect is there to ensure that neighbors are good borrowers before you approve a request.
- Add a way to charge a fee for tools to be borrowed.
