            <p>Tired of loaning out your tools to a neighbor and losing them? Use My Tools help you keep track of who has your tools as well as creating a resource for the community.</p>

                - Users can log in and create a profile. - They can then set up items they have available - anything from a shovel to power washers and tile saws. - Users will be able to Create, Read, Update and Delete data. - A 2nd user can log in and see items that
                users have available and request to borrow. - When a tool has been borrowed, the owner needs to see on their profile what tools are lent out and who has them.
            </p>
            <h1>## STRETCH</h1>
            <p></p>
            - Add a map for loaners to set limits on how far they are willing to lend their tools out, and how far borrowers are willing to drive to borrow something. - Add a review system into the app so that the social aspect is there to ensure that neighbors are
            good borrowers before you approve a request. - Add a way to charge a fee for tools to be borrowed.
